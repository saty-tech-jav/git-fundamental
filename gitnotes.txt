#Fundamentals of Github and git NOTES
GIT:

Version control system is a tools that helps to track change in code.

1.It helps to track the history
2.Collaborate with peers

GITHUB:

Website that allows developers to store and manage their code using git.

folder==repository

README.md file is the basic file structure

2 step generally involved

1.add
2.commit

COMMANDS

1.git --version
2.git add .(For adding modified files and all newly added files)
3.git add <filename> (for specific file name)
4.git commit -m "adding first change"

CONFIGURATION OF GIT

5.git config --global user.name "satyamkumar"
6.git config --global user.email "sat133kumar@gmail.com"
7.git config --list

remote is called=git hub repo
local is called=laptop/pc

8.ls -a (command used for watching hidden files)
9.ls (to see all the files)
10. cd d: (to change directory)
11. cd .. (To come out from directory)
12.mkdir (Create new directory)
13.git status (For checking the status)
14.git clone (For clonning the project)

Change==modified
new file=untracked
add=staged (add new or changed files in your working directory to the git staging area)
commit=unchanged (it is the record of change)

15.git push origin main (for pushing code in repo/remote from local)

BRANCHES

16.git branch (to check branch)
17.git branch -M main(to rename branch)
18.git checkout <branch name>  -- (for switching to that given branch name)
19.git checkout -b <branch-name> --(for creating new branch)
20.git branch  -d <branch-name> --(to delete branch)

MERGING CODE

21.git diff <branch name>  --comparision will made to <branch-name> by switched branch name
22.git merge <branch name> 
23.Merging of branch can be done by creating PR(Pull request)

GIT CONFLICT

An event that takes place when git is unable to automatically resolve difference in code 
between branches.

RENAMING OF BRANCH ON GITHUB ALSO

24.git push origin :old-name-of-branch-on-github
25.git branch -m old-name-of-branch-on-github new-name-for-branch-you-want
26.git push origin new-name-for-branch-you-want

CREATION OF REPO FROM COMMAND LINE 

27.echo "# EX" >> README.md
28.git init
29.git add README.md
30.git commit -m "first commit"
31.git branch -M main
32.git remote add origin https://github.com/saty-tech-jav/EX.git
33.git push -u origin main




 PUSH EXISTING REPO FROM COMMAND LINE


34.git remote add origin https://github.com/saty-tech-jav/EX.git
35.git branch -M main
36.git push -u origin main
